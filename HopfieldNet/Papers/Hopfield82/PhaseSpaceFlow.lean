# Hopfield Networks: Formalization of J.J. Hopfield's 1982 Paper

This module formalizes the key mathematical concepts from J.J. Hopfield's 1982 paper
"Neural networks and physical systems with emergent collective computational abilities",
focusing on aspects that are not already covered in the main HopfieldNet formalization.

The paper introduces a model of neural networks with binary neurons and studies their collective
computational properties, particularly as content-addressable memories. The key insights include:

1. The phase space flow and stable states of the network
2. The storage capacity and pattern retrieval capabilities
3. The relationship between energy minimization and memory retrieval
4. Tolerance to noise and component failures

## Main Components

* `PhaseSpaceFlow`: Formalization of phase space flow and attractors
* `MemoryCapacity`: Relationship between memory capacity and error rates
* `MemoryConfusion`: Formalization of how similar memories can interfere
* `FaultTolerance`: Analysis of network robustness to component failures

## References

* Hopfield, J.J. (1982). Neural networks and physical systems with emergent collective
  computational abilities. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 79(8), 2554-2558.

/--
A `PhaseSpacePoint` represents a state in the phase space of the Hopfield system.
In the paper, this corresponds to the instantaneous state of all neurons (p.2554):
"A point in state space then represents the instantaneous condition of the system."

  let arr := match o with
    | some v => #[v]
    | none => #[0]
  Vector.mk arr (by
    cases o <;> rfl)

  some (v.get 0)

/-- Extract threshold value safely --/
def getThreshold (θ : Option R) : R :=
  match θ with
  | some v => v
  | none => 0

/--
The `localField` for neuron i in state s is the weighted sum of inputs from other neurons,
minus the threshold. This corresponds to ∑j Tij Vj - θi in the paper.

  (∑ j ∈ Finset.univ, wθ.w i j * s.act j) - getThreshold (vectorToOption (wθ.θ i))
/--
The `updateRule` defines the neural state update according to the paper's Equation 1:
    Vi → 1 if ∑j Tij Vj > Ui
    Vi → 0 if ∑j Tij Vj < Ui

In our formalization, we use -1 instead of 0 for the "not firing" state.

def updateRule [DecidableEq R] [DecidableEq U] (wθ : Params (HopfieldNetwork R U)) (s : PhaseSpacePoint R U) (i : U) : R :=
  if localField wθ s i > 0 then 1 else -1

/--
A `PhaseSpaceFlow` describes how the system state evolves over time.
It maps each point in phase space to its successor state after updating one neuron.

From the paper (p.2554): "The equations of motion of the system describe a flow in state space."
-/
def PhaseSpaceFlow [DecidableEq R] [DecidableEq U] (wθ : Params (HopfieldNetwork R U)) (useq : ℕ → U) : PhaseSpacePoint R U → PhaseSpacePoint R U :=
  λ (s : PhaseSpacePoint R U) => s.Up wθ (useq 0)

/--
A `FixedPoint` of the phase space flow is a state that does not change under evolution.
In the paper, these correspond to the locally stable states of the network (p.2554):
"Various classes of flow patterns are possible, but the systems of use for memory
particularly include those that flow toward locally stable points..."
-/
def FixedPoint [DecidableEq R] [DecidableEq U] (wθ : Params (HopfieldNetwork R U)) (s : PhaseSpacePoint R U) : Prop :=
  s.isStable wθ

/--
A `BasinOfAttraction` of a fixed point is the set of all states that converge to it.
In the paper (p.2554): "Then, if the system is started sufficiently near any Xa,
as at X = Xa + Δ, it will proceed in time until X ≈ Xa."
-/
def BasinOfAttraction [DecidableEq R] [DecidableEq U] (wθ : Params (HopfieldNetwork R U)) (p : PhaseSpacePoint R U)
    (useq : ℕ → U) (hf : fair useq) : Set (PhaseSpacePoint R U) :=
  {s | ∃ n : ℕ, seqStates wθ s useq n = p ∧ FixedPoint wθ p ∧ convergence_is_fair s useq hf}
  where
    convergence_is_fair (_ : PhaseSpacePoint R U) (useq : ℕ → U) (_ : fair useq) : Prop := fair useq

/--
The `EnergyLandscape` of a Hopfield network is the energy function defined over all possible states.
In the paper, this is the function E defined in Equation 7:
    E = -1/2 ∑∑ Tij Vi Vj

def EnergyLandscape [DecidableEq R] [DecidableEq U] (wθ : Params (HopfieldNetwork R U)) : PhaseSpacePoint R U → R :=
  λ (s : PhaseSpacePoint R U) => s.E wθ

The `EnergyChange` when updating neuron i is always non-positive,
as proven in the paper with Equation 8.

This theorem formalizes a key result from the paper: the energy function
always decreases (or remains constant) under asynchronous updates.

This theorem captures the convergence result from the paper:
"Every initial state flows to a limit point (if synchrony is not assumed)."

The proof leverages the HopfieldNet_convergence_fair theorem from the existing codebase.
