  Definition of a Layered Architecture.
  A network is 'Layered' if its neurons can be partitioned into
  an ordered list of disjoint sets (layers),
  and arrows only exist between adjacent layers (i -> i+1).
  -- This structure is the exact mathematical object needed to bridge the gap:

--      A neural net is implicitly this structure (a sequence of operations).

--     A neural net is a Quiver.

--     The Bridge: This structure LayeredStructure identifies
-- the subset of Quivers that behave like Isabelle networks.

  -- The ordered list of layers (e.g., [Input, Hidden1, Hidden2, Output])
  layers : List (Finset U)

  -- 1. Partition Property: Every neuron belongs to exactly one layer
  -- We assert the union is the universe (surjective) AND they are pairwise disjoint (injective)
  h_cover : (layers.foldl (· ∪ ·) ∅) = Finset.univ
  h_disjoint : layers.Pairwise Disjoint

  -- 2. Feedforward Property: Edges only go from Layer i to Layer i+1
  -- If there is a connection u -> v, then u is in layer i and v is in layer i+1

  The Simultaneous update used in sequential models (like the Isabelle paper).
  It calculates the new state for *all* neurons in 'layer' based on the
  *snapshot* of the previous state 's'.
  Crucially, it does NOT see updates happening to other neurons in the same layer.

  THEOREM: Generalization of Sequential Models
  For any Neural Network that satisfies the 'LayeredStructure' constraints (Isabelle model),
  executing your asynchronous 'workPhase' along the topological sort
  yields the EXACT SAME result as the sequential matrix-style inference.

  Significance: This proves the Isabelle model is a strict subset of the NNquiv model.
