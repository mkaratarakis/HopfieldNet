-- ** Classification of metric spaces

-- A metric space is located if you can choose
-- between ball d x y and ~ball e x y for e < d. Every located metric
-- is a stable metric. This translates the located property of the real
-- numbers e < d -> (e < d(x,y) \/ d(x,y) < d). *)
-- Definition locatedMetric (ms:MetricSpace) :=
--   forall (e d:Q) (x y:ms),
--     e < d -> {ball d x y}+{~ball e x y}.

/--
A metric space is located if for all `e < d`,
you can choose between `ball d x y` and `¬ ball e x y`.

-- (** At the top level a metric space is decidable if its ball relation
-- is decidable.  Every decidable metric is a located metric. *)

-- Definition decidableMetric (ms:MetricSpace) :=
--  forall e (x y:ms), {ball e x y}+{~ball e x y}.
