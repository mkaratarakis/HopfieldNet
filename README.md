# Hopfield Networks

## Description
This repository contains Lean formalizations related to Hopfield Networks written in the *Lean theorem prover* language.

Below is a brief overview of the key files:

- **`Asym.lean`** – Formalization of asymmetric Hopfield networks.  
- **`HN.lean`** – Formalization of symmetric Hopfield networks.  
- **`NN.lean`** – Formalization of General neural networks.  
- **`Stochastic.lean`** – Formalization of stochastic algorithms.  
- **`aux.lean`** – Auxiliary lemmas.  
- **`test.lean`** – Computations and implementation of the Hebbian learning algorithm.  

For more details, see the individual files.
