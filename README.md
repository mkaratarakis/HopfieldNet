# Hopfield Networks

## Description
This repository contains Lean formalizations related to Hopfield Networks written in the *Lean theorem prover* language.

Below is a brief overview of the key files:

- **`HopfieldNet/Asym.lean`** – Formalization of asymmetric Hopfield networks.  
- **`HopfieldNet/HN.lean`** – Formalization of symmetric Hopfield networks.  
- **`HopfieldNet/NN.lean`** – Formalization of general neural networks.  
- **`HopfieldNet/Stochastic.lean`** – Formalization of stochastic theory for Hopfield networks.  
- **`HopfieldNet/aux.lean`** – Auxiliary lemmas.  
- **`HopfieldNet/test.lean`** – Computations and implementation of the Hebbian learning algorithm.  

For more details, see the individual files.
